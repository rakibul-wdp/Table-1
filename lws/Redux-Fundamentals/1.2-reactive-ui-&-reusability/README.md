# Reactive UI & Reusability
### With React State Management & Components

#### What we have learnt so far
- Our application had 3 parts - state, view, and action
- State is the source of truth that drives our app
- view is the declarative description of the UI based on the current state
- Action are the events that occur in the app based on user input and trigger updates in the state
- This is called one-way data flow

#### One-way data flow
- View -> Action -> State -> View -> Action....
